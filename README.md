# dns_record_type_json
JSON representation of DNS record types based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#Resource_records

I needed a quick way to map DNS QTYPE values to names and vice versa. After searching online for JSON that and failing to find
what I was looking for, I decided to do a quick scrape of the wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record). 

Maybe I'll do one based on http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml next since it seems be more authoritative.
